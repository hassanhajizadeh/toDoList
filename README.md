TO-DO List App
Created using HTML , CSS , Vanilla JS

I made this options for tasks:

1. Mark task as done
2. Reorder tasks by drag and drop
3. Setting reminder for tasks
4. Add , Delete and modify tasks
5. Sort tasks based on latest(default) or deadlines. (just once change to see the sorting)

I also used sessionStorage to store data, ensuring that it is deleted after closing the browser and does not occupy additional space on the user's device. Additionally, I have included a dark theme button for comfort and ease of use.

inside the source code , codes are explained via comments. i tried cover all sections .

feel free to use the code .
