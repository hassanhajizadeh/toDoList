TO-DO List App
Created using HTML , CSS , Vanilla JS

We made this options for tasks:

1. Mark task as done
2. Reorder tasks by drag and drop
3. Setting reminder for tasks
4. Add , Delete and modify tasks
5. Sort tasks based on latest(default) or deadlines or categories (alphabetically) or Priority.

We also used sessionStorage to store data, ensuring that it is deleted after closing the browser and does not occupy additional space on the user's device. Additionally, we have included a dark theme button for comfort and ease of use.
