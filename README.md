TO-DO List App
Created using HTML , CSS , Vanilla JS

We made this options for tasks:

1. Mark task as done
2. Reorder tasks by drag and drop
3. Setting reminder for tasks
4. Add , Delete and modify tasks

We also used sessionStorage to store data so that after closing the browser, the stored data is deleted and does not occupy additional space on the user's device. and we have included a dark-theme button for the comfort and ease of use.
